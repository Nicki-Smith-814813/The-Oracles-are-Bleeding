## 🧿 About the Game

**The Oracles are Bleeding** is a dark, text-based horror game inspired by ancient Greek myth and tragedy. You play as **Melas**, a cursed oracle driven to awaken the gods — or die trying — during a divine drought. But something answers your prayers that isn’t who you're expecting.

Explore haunted shrines, confront mythic forces like **Demeter**, **Thanatos**, and **Hecate**, and survive trials that test more than just your mind.
